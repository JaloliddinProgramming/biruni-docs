# LMS

In this guide, we will build a **Learning Management System (LMS)** application using the **Biruni framework**, starting entirely from scratch. The primary purpose of this documentation is to demonstrate the practical usage of the Biruni framework through a simplified, real-world example.

We will walk through the full project setup—from **registering the LMS project in the database**, to **designing table structures**, creating **modules**, and implementing **business logic**. We’ll also build **APIs** used by UI packages, and define **route actions** to handle user interactions from pages, primarily through forms.

To keep the guide focused and easy to follow, we will implement a module — `Courses`. In a full LMS system, there would typically be many more modules covering various aspects of functionality (e.g. `User management`, `Exams`, `Communication and collaboration`).

This documentation provides a complete walkthrough that helps to understand how to structure, build, and connect all components of a working application in the Biruni framework.
